It's been quite a while since my last post about Rust, which didn't really talk about its core philosophy and how it
worked, so this was written as an introduction to Rust for people who have already dabbled with the C programming
language family. Additionally, if you don't know what binary search trees are, I strongly recommend taking a look at
them first.

# Ownership

We must first talk about ownership before implementing our BST. In Rust, an object must be owned by
something and only that something. For example, take an uncopiable type `A`, the following code would result in
compilation error.

```rust
let x: A = ...; // ownership of ... is x
let y = x; // transfers ownership to y
x...; // errors
```

So to reference `x` without `x` losing ownership requires "borrowing", which is split into two categories: shared
references(&) and exclusive(mutable, &mut) references. The former is a pointer to a constant piece of memory that you can't
edit via the pointer, the latter is a pointer to an editable piece of memory. There can only be at most one mutable
reference to `x` per scope, and if there is a mutable reference to `x`, there must not be any shared references to `x` in
that scope.

# Node and Leave

In C, we can define a BST node like this:

```c
struct node {
  int key;
  struct node *left, *right;
};
```

A `node` has two pointers pointing to other `node`s. Note that their allocation is not concretely defined by our struct
itself. If the left/right child is empty, then the value of it is set to `(struct node*)NULL`. This approach has some downsides,
though, most notably the fact that you have to free the memory itself if you allocate heap memory. This would result in
memory leaks should you forget to do so.

In Rust, since a node can only be connected to its parent, and knowing the node's parent is optional, we can define a
BST tree and a BST node like is:

```rust
struct BSTNode<T> {
  left: BST<T>,
  right: BST<T>,
  pub key: i32,
  pub val: T,
}

pub struct BST<T> {
  node: Option<Box<BSTNode<T>>>,
}
```

Evidently, we define an intermediate struct called `BST<T>`, which is a container for an optional `Box<node>` property.
A `Box` is simply a unique pointer to an area of heap memory that would be dropped once the `Box` isn't owned. If the
property is a `None`, then the BST is simply an empty tree. Some people might do this

```rust
pub struct BST<T> {
  left: Option<Box<BST<T>>>,
  right: Option<Box<BST<T>>>,
  pub key: i32,
  pub val: T,
}
```

to make their code more succinct, and it does work, but you can't represent an empty tree without using `Option` on the
top level, so we'll stick to the first implementation for the rest of this article.
Let's implement some simple functions for our BST.

```rust
impl<T> BST<T> {
  // an empty BST
  pub fn new_empty() -> Self {
    Self { node: None }
  }
  // a BST with one node
  pub fn new(key: i32, val: T) -> Self {
    Self {
      node: Some(Box::new(BSTNode::new(key, val))),
    }
  }
  pub fn is_empty(&self) -> bool {
    self.node.is_none()
  }
  pub fn insert(&mut self, key: i32, val: T) {
    if let Some(root) = &mut self.node {
      // match is a way to split and pattern match results
      match root.key.cmp(&key) {
        Ordering::Equal => {
          panic!("BST should not have same id!");
          // bad practice ^
        }
        Ordering::Greater => { // root.key > key
          root.left.insert(key, val);
        }
        Ordering::Less => {
          root.right.insert(key, val);
        }
      }
    } else {
      self.node = Some(Box::new(BSTNode::new(key, val)));
    }
  }
}
```

Here, `Box::new` is a way to allocate heap memory.

# BST Deletion

Next, we'll define deletion in BST. To deletion node `n` in a BST, we can discuss individual cases:

1. `n` is a leave: Make `n` an empty tree.
2. `n` has only one child: Make the child take its place.
3. `n` has two children: Make `n`'s inorder successor its place without changing `n`'s children.

Then, we write down the code.

```rust
impl<T: Clone> BST<T> {
  fn extract_min(&mut self) -> Option<Box<BSTNode<T>>> {
    let Some(root) = &mut self.node {
      return None;
    };

    if !root.left.is_empty() {
      return root.left.extract_min();
    }

    // find the inorder successor and take it in the process
    return self.node.take();
  }

  pub fn remove(&mut self, key: i32) {
    let Some(root) = &mut self.node else {
      return;
    };
    match root.key.cmp(&key) {
      Ordering::Equal => match (root.left.node.as_ref(), root.right.node.as_ref()) {
        (None, None) => {
          self.node.take();
          // take itself, become an empty tree
        }
        (Some(_), None) => {
          self.node = root.left.node.take();
          // copy left node to self
          // make left node an empty tree, without ownership, it would be dropped
        }
        (None, Some(_)) => {
          self.node = root.right.node.take();
          // copy right node to self
          // make right node an empty tree, without ownership, it would be dropped
        }
        (Some(_), Some(_)) => {
          if let Some(x) = root.right.extract_min() {
            root.key = x.key;
            root.val = x.val.clone();
          }
        }
      },
      Ordering::Greater => {
        root.left.remove(key);
      }
      Ordering::Less => {
        root.right.remove(key);
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`Option::take` is simply a way to replace the memory at `Some(x)` to `None`, and copy `Some(x)` to the output.
If `Option<Box<T>>` is taken, the original `Box<T>` is dropped, with the new `Box` immediately instantiated. This
may all be optimized away, though. The taken node then causes the BST owning it to become an empty tree.

# A small step

In this article, we gained some insight regarding how Rust's ownership system worked, but we haven't talked about
another important concept in rust, which is lifetime! See you in the next post.
