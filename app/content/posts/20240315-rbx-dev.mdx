This post is a brief overview of my development process and the netcode I use in Roblox.
Let's get started.

## Development Process

Typescript is great for a type-safe and organized codebase. For Roblox, I use [Roblox-TS](https://roblox-ts.com/),
a Typescript-to-Luau transpiler. Via [Rojo](https://rojo.space/), I can sync the transpiled code to Roblox Studio.
For version control, I use Git and GitHub. Additionally, to create beautiful and readable code, I use ESLint and Prettier
that are run automatically every time I save a file.

## Libraries

I keep my project as raw as possible, so I only use a few libraries to aid my development process.
Here are the libraries I use:

### Matter

[Matter](https://eryn.io/matter/) is an ECS library. I am personally a big fan of ECS since my first encounter with it
in Unity. Since it is based on immediate mode, codes are more readable and maintainable. For Roblox, among all the ECS
libraries, Matter is the most well-maintained and feature-rich library. It is also guarded with immutability, which
ensures no weird bugs due to mutation.

### RbxNet

[RbxNet](https://rbxnet.australis.dev) is a simple networking library. While it is based on Roblox's RemoteEvent, it
provides a more organized and type-safe way to handle networking. You can also combine UUID Obfuscation to slow down
exploiters; nevertheless, it is not a silver bullet for all my networking needs.

### Fusion

[Fusion](https://elttob.uk/Fusion/) provides a simple way to create semi-declarative UIs. I used to use Roact, but
due to Roblox's imperative nature, I found Fusion to be more fitting for my needs. It is also more lightweight.

## Netcode

Inspired by the netcode in Overwatch, I've written a simple netcode based on the classic client-server model.
Here's a brief overview of the netcode:

### Client

The client is predictive, meaning it predicts the future state of the game. It sends the input to the server and
simulates the game based on the input immediately regardless of the server's response, which yields a temporary
_ephemeral state_. When the server responds, the client corrects the game via something called _ephemeral cleanup_.
This is done by a simple callback that is called when the server responds. This approach is better when the state
cannot be numerically calculated, such as animations and physics.

### Server

The server is authoritative, meaning it has the final say in the game state. It receives the input from the client,
validates it, and dispatches the command. It then sends a simple response to the client: success or failure. For syncing
components and entities, the server has to process replicatable components and entities. This is done within a
replication system that is called last in the game loop.

### Action-based Framework

The netcode in this model is action-based, meaning the input is a simple action and is discrete. For example, in an
FPS game, the input is a simple action such as "shoot" or "move". When a world (the upmost structure of ECS) reconciles
an action, it is called a _dispatch_. If the changed components are replicatable, they are then sent to the client;
conversely, on the client, reverse replication (sending input to the server) can only be called actively rather than
passively, which means the code has to specify that it wants to send an action to the server.

The following is a simple example of networking:

```
client
    INTERACT & EPH STATE -> SEND INPUT
server                      |
    SEND RES <- DISPATCH <- VALIDATE
client  |
    EPH CLEANUP -> (debug) SEND TO LOG
```

This framework is not without any flaws. It is not suitable for values that are continuous. For example, in a racing
game, the speed of the car is continuous and cannot be represented as a simple action. In this case, the netcode has to
incorporate a different model, such as a state-based model, making it exponentially more complex. The additional
ephemeral cleanup also adds more complexity to the codebase.

## Examples

All the talks are abstract, so here are some examples.

### Animations

Animations are considered performance-intense, which means that they need to have precision down to a single frame, or
there would be visible artifacts. Solving this issue requires a view-model-hydration system. Only the view model is
replicated. The hydration process only occurs in clients. A view model is a concept that requires much less information
than the actual thing it tries to represent. When hydration commences, a view model is implemented as the actual thing.

In my system, `CAnimationView` is the view model of `CAnimation`. `CAnimationView` contains a list of animation names.
Given that clients have already owned their own list of animations, `CAnimation` can be hydrated by using a LUT and
loading animations into tracks.

During early development, I found it extremely frustrating to work with Roblox's implicit client-to-server animation
replication process that didn't allow selective filtering. Fortunately, by implementing an observer system on the
server, I could stop client-sided animations from getting sent to others. This took me longer than I had expected due
to the poorly-documented API docs (e.g. names are not replicated but ids are, which isn't documented at all.)

### To be added

## Conclusion

Having read all this, you might be wondering if developing on Roblox requires all this complexity. The answer is no,
but it is a nice foundation for a more intricate game. Roblox is a platform that is easy to get started with, but it
is far from easy to create a stable and scalable architecture. I hope this post has given you a brief overview of my
development process and the netcode I use in Roblox. If you have any questions, just drop by my Discord @algasami.
