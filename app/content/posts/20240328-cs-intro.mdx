This article can serve as a brochure during your journey
to pursue computer Science. Should there be any flaws, please inform the author.

_This article might suffer from regional differences since it is tailored toward Taiwanese._

## 1. What do we learn in CS?

When talking about comp sci, many people think they are highly pertinent to programming.
However, that is simply not the case. Computer science places more emphasis on math, logics
and paradigms. Relatively, programming only takes a small portion of it when it comes to
implementation.

### 1.1 Math Knowledge

Since computer science is a branch of applied math, it is not difficult to see that comp sci
requires extensive math knowledge. At first, discrete math, a field that focuses on quantized qualities,
would be taught, in which we would first learn about number theory, which only researches theories
related to $\mathbb{Z}$. Since many of these theories were elegantly written,
even Mr. Carl Friedrich Gauss said "Mathematics is the queen of the sciences—and number theory is the queen of mathematics."

Subsequently, theories would be introduced in a specific order -- from narrow to broad. For instance,
graph theory is taught after group theory, and category theory is taught after graph theory.

Needless to say, algorithms and data structures would also be taught, including graph traversal, simulation,
which can enable us to solve problems like traveling salesman problem and Josephus problem. Aside from discrete
math, comp sci also requires vast knowledge in calculus, which would be used in fields like DSP
(Digital Signal Processing.)

### 1.2 Computer Mechanism

While it might clash with your preconceived opinion, computer science also has to learn about how computers
work in depth, though less detailed than computer engineering. Everything ranged from the von Neumann
architecture to VHDLs is crucial as they act as cornerstones for a great programmer who thinks in a low-level
manner. This skill directly benefits the learning of assembly later on.

### 1.3 Programming

At first, we would be introduced to the C programming language. Notably, C is the most low-level high-level
language, so it does bear a lot of educational value on its own. Then assembly would slap us in the face...
Universities often teach about Intel x86_64 ISA, but some are observed to teach about RISC-V and ARM as well.
Lastly, if you are passionate about math, you must be extremely satisfied by $\lambda$ calculus. It is also the
foundation of functional programming; in fact, $\lambda$ calculus is one of the earliest programming languages
ever created!

### 2. Future Prospect

Some parts below were cited from [公職王](https://www.public.com.tw/exam-education/univ-univcomputer-intro).

- Programmer: The most general term for somebody who not only writes programs but also coordinates their team,
steering it toward to right direction. They must have strong esprit de corps and a sense of responsibility.

- Computer Systems Analyst: Computer systems analysts analyze crucial mechanisms such as DevOps and robustness
in software and systems with their years of experience.

- Game Developer: While sounding like making a game, game developers in large studios only work on designated
parts; nevertheless, indie developers can work on their games at their disposal, maintaining their own pace.

To summation, computer science has many occupation opportunities. As more and more kaleidoscopic technologies
spring up, it's not hard to see that there would be even more chances!

## 3. How to git gud?

Be focused and disciplined. Always preview and contemplate all the time. There are a multitude of resources
coming in various forms including videos, books and papers. For beginners, you can read Structure and
Interpretation of Computer Programs. The book is straightforward and introduces you to the world of functional
programming. Talking about math, you can read baby rudin and Discrete Math by Richard Johnsonbaugh. Solving
problems can enhance your knowledge in DSA, but beware, solving problems does not guarantee abilities to write
scalable and maintainable codes, which have to be cultivated by long-term cooperation with fellow programmers.

Happy Hacking!

## 4. Useful Tools

These are some tools I prefer to use ranging from software to hardware.

### 4.1 Neovim

While some people might be upset by my choice since they think Vi and Vim are enough, I still like the neat
features of neovim. You can take a look at my
[dotfiles](https://github.com/algasami/nixos_dotfiles/blob/main/users/algasami/home/programs/nvim.nix)
to see how I configure it. I personally dislike autocompletion since it distracts me from actual work.
Vim-like editors benefit from the fact that your hands seldom leave your keyboard,
rendering you more productive.

### 4.2 Tmux

I personally use Hyprland whenever I'm in a Linux environment, but sometimes, tmux is also useful when you
can't use tiling manager. You can also use it via SSH, and it supports detaching and reattaching.

### 4.3 GNU Collection

GNU software is stable and robust.

- GNU Compiler Collection: GCC is a pretty useful product. It contains linkers, archivers and compilers.
- GDB: A convenient debugger on the x86_64 platform. It can be used to sniff call stacks and memory heaps.
- GNU Coreutils: Some useful functions including transpiling assembly.

### 4.4 Peripherals

Keebs and monitors.

- Tex Shinobi: Tex Shinobi is a mechanical keyboard with an aspect ratio of 1:1. It has a built-in hand tray.
- HHKB Layout: HHKB layout keyboards are smaller and easier to type on. I currently use HHKB Hybrid Type-S.
It takes some time to adapt to, though.
- 21:9 Monitors: This aspect ratio is golden, not as stretched as 31:9 and not as narrow as 16:9. I'm still
yearning for the date when 21:9 4K OLED comes...
- A4 Grid Papers: For math problems and daydreaming only.
- Pental Smash: A series of mechanical pens that feel like gliding through clouds when using them to write.

## 5. Legendary Figures

These are all my subjective opinions.

### 5.1 Richard Matthew Stallman (RMS)

The creator of Free Software Movement, Stallman has been fighting for FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) for
decades. One of the awe-inspiring achievements he has done was the founding of GNU -- the amalgamation of FOSS,
including operation systems and libraries. The Linux kernel that Linus Tarvold developed was then merged into
the project, becoming GNU/Linux or GNU+Linux.

### 5.2 Linus Tarvold

The author and the main developer of the Linux kernel project. It was meant as a FOSS version of UNIX,
but accidentally became the most popular open source kernel in the world. To this date, Linux is still one of
the most sought-after choices for programmers. From my viewpoint, I think the most admiring thing he's done
is not the fact that he made in linux, but the fact that he's been consistently checking pull requests for
over twenty decades in the Linux kernel lore, which testifies his stunning perseverance and enthusiasm.

Should you want to see Linus Tarvold roasting people in action, go to
[Linux Kernel Lore](https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/). Please proceed with caution!
Filing a PR without getting roasted by Linus is a medal to be worn with pride. ξ( ✿ ＞ ◡❛)
