It's been a while since I last updated my websites with coding-related topics, as I have been quite busy with all the schoolwork.
This article is meant to be my own tiny rent; pardon me if I'm being too emotional and subjective.

I'd always thought high of myself since I was young. Having read the stories about Feynman and Fermi, my dream occupation was
theoretical physics, which later changed to nuclear engineering. For whatever reason, I somehow caught the "protagonist" syndrome
in elementary school and middle school, probably due to praises and my own immaturity. I had an inflated ego, and considered myself unbeatable,
until one day I found myself on a hospital bed, at the brink of death. I was only discharged after a month of terror. The event left me in an existential
crisis. I realized that I had never been any different from others regarding my destiny -- a person who could be sent to the oblivion of death by anything.
This thought wandered in my mind like a looming specter, rendering me depressed for quite a long time.

After some time of contemplation and meditation, my perspective of life, however, altered from a nihilistic view to a more optimistic one. There are always
plagues, sufferings and hatred in this world. It is indisputable that we live in a dark age, but it doesn't stop us from forging ahead no matter how fierce
the fire is spreading, how strong the blizzard is ravaging and how fast the temperature is surging. If people in the most unforgiving environment can endure
and let their indomitable spirit shine through the gloomy clouds, why can't I, a naive student taking everything he has for granted, be positive about my life?
This spark in my mind instantaneously pierced layers of my thoughts. From that point, I became more grateful for my own life.

For our posterity, for ourselves, we must all keep on keeping on, lest the night of the humanity should fall as we lament our misfortune.
