[Question Link](https://zerojudge.tw/ShowProblem?problemid=j608)

This is a variant of the time scheduling problem. We can solve it with
dynamic programming and greedy:
Given n intervals and k machines, find the highest number of intervals
occupied by concurrent machines.
This question involves the following hypothesis (or conjecture since I don't
know how to prove it):

### 1

For k=1, selecting the interval that ends the earliest leaves the maximum
number of possible intervals in the future (we are always propagating
forward).

### 2

For k>1, combined with the first statement, which is true also in this
circumstance, using the machine that ends the latest can help us with finding
the answer to the global maxima, and unused machines should always be
reserved **unless none could be chosen**.
The reason for prioritizing machines which ends the latest is that as we move
to the future, the possibility of machines working relatively **early** being
able to be assigned to the intervals increases, so we reserve those with
early tasks by using machines with latest tasks.
That for unused machines is also quite similar to the above. Since unused
machines are guaranteed to work given any intervals, they are the last cards
we want to play.
