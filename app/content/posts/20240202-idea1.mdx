How do we rationalize irrational ideas? Here's my approach.

# World A

After WWII, peace was not restored; instead, the tension between nations started to grow, with resources depleted due to wars.
A group of scientists were designated to a confidential project by the US government to hopefully "keep the world machine rolling
to the right direction". Details of it are the following.

## Entanglement

When two objects are entangled, their information has an explicit relationship, namely a morphism that can transform one information to another.
For example, when two electrons are entangled. They have opposite spin directions. You can know another electron's spin by looking at one with
its superposition collapsed. Note that there is no information being transferred, so entanglement is instantaneous.

## Tanglators

Archeological research has shown that ancient civilizations worshipped some sacred items which could seemingly link two entities together.
These items are called the Artifacts by archeologists. The properties of them could not be determined solely by deciphering ancient manuscripts, though.
Some argue that the Rosetta Stone was erected as the symbol of "entanglement", as translation itself can be thought as one to an extent.

## E.R.A

Subsequent to the Manhattan project, the Entanglement Research Agency (ERA) was established to contend with the rapid development in Soviet's nuclear technology.
Located directly underneath its predecessor, the ERA enjoyed a well-guarded laboratory with a multitude of apparatus and facilities. Being deep underground also
means that its members could capture and interact with elementary particles that would be interfered by weather conditions. Additionally, warhead tests were being
frequently carried out, which gave the ERA some opportunities to examine ground zero.
In 1952, Dr.Ganzorig became the first
person recorded to ever interact with a tanglator (T0) at ground zero after the detonation of a miniature nuclear warhead. "Holding it gave me
a vision of a grandiose palace that could only appear in the most vivid dream of mine," Ganzorig said in the 1996 interview featured in the popular TV series
_Science with Hellman_.

The appearance of tanglators at ground zero, as well as the side-effects they imposed, left the bright-minded puzzled. While the mystery of their appearance is still
undiscovered, the side-effects have been extensively studied. A detailed list of experiment records is attached below.

### T0 Pocket Watch

The subject was found approximately two meters away from the blast center. We had to be extra careful owing to its fragile nature. T0 contains no radioactive after
decontamination. The shape of it resembles an antique pocket watch weighing around two hundred grams. Radiometric dating shows that the material used could be traced
back to nineteen thousand years ago, far older than any civilizations, which means that T0 can well be our first tanglator and an anachronism. When I first grabbed it
with my bare hands, warmth breezed threw my body. I could see an ephemeral image of the interior of an unknown building. This phenomenon is pretty intriguing, so I
mentioned it here. _- Dr. Ganzorig_

### T1 Exquisite Impossible Bottle

This was meant to be written in a more rigorous way, but I couldn't find another way to describe this fascinating gizmo, so please bear with me. In a similar fashion
to T0, T1 was retrieved near the blast zone, the only discrepancy being it appeared two days later. Just like any other impossible bottles, there is an intricate ship
inside and some sand to simulate ocean waves. When gently rotated to create waves, it gave me a vision of a large vessel -- wooden one that seemed like it was from the
age of discovery. It was so vivid that I sat at this very desk fiddling with it for hours. Sadly, it seems like there won't be any new tanglators appearing soon. _- Dr. Ganzorig_

## Post Arm Race

Another war ignited after a failed ceasefire attempt between the USSR and USA, with each side arming their missile silos, a precarious equilibrium struck between them.
Numerous proxy wars went off and millions had perished. At the darkest corners of each side stood their best scientists, racing to gain an advantage. They were aware of
the sheer power of tanglators. If they could induce entanglements storng enough to shape the reality around them, any kinds of attacks would be rendered useless; hence,
the ERA was split into multiple sites, ranging from site alpha to site tau. At the same time, the soviet concentrated their effort into one shadow company -- Gime Infrastructure (GI),
which concealed its investment in pursuit of tanglators, splitting the discovery into two branches, the ERA and the GI one.
