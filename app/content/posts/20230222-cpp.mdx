## Ode to the First C++ Program

```cpp
// Thy first program, young elf
// To thee, we grant this spell

#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello World!";
    return 0;
}
```

Oh, young elf, thy first program so fair,

Embark upon thy coding quest with care.

With sword and shield, and magic in thy hands,

Thy journey starts with this humble command.

"Hello World!" thy program doth declare,

As thou learn the language of the software.

May thy code be elegant, precise, and pure,

A magic spell that shall forever endure.

Thy journey, long and winding, doth begin,

A quest for knowledge, and for fame, and for kin.

May the stars above guide thee on thy way,

As thou bring thy dreams to life, day by day.

Now go, young elf, with courage in thy heart,

For the world awaits, with wonders and with art.

May thy coding skills be sharp as an elven blade,

And may thy programs shine, like a sunlit glade.

Copy and paste this poem, if thou shall,

For in thy code, may it bring good fortune to all.
