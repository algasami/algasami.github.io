An articulation point is a vertex that when removed, can result in two or more disconnected graphs. When a graph does
not have any articulation points, it is called a biconnected graph. Such a graph with the maximum possible nodes
is called a biconnected component. Finding these articulation points can directly lead to the discovery of biconnected
subgraphs; thus, we need a way to do this quickly.

## Naive Algorithm

We can run an algorithm that uses dfs to visit the entire graph every time we remove a vertex.

```
nodes = 1000
visited = [0, ..., 0]
algorithm DFS(now, removed):
  visited[now] = true
  for n in now.adjs:
    if n == removed:
      continue
    DFS(n, removed)

algorithm get_components():
  aps = []
  og_components = 0
  for i from 0 to nodes:
    if visited[i] is false:
      components = components + 1
      DFS(now, -1)
  for i from 0 to nodes: -- removes i
    visited = [0, ..., 0]
    components = 0
    for j from 0 to nodes:
      if i == j:
        continue
      if visited[i] is false:
        components = components + 1
        DFS(now, i)
    if components > og_components:
      aps = aps + 1
  return aps
```

## Tarjan's Algorithm

However, the above algorithm evidently has some fatal flaws, with the biggest one being its inefficiency, so in 1973,
John Hopcroft and Robert Tarjan devised a new algorithm. This algorithm works by taking note of the discovery time
of a node, and use a special value called _lowpoint_ to deduce if we can travel to the node faster than using a
specific point to bypass the lack of back edges (edges that are connected back to the upper layers of a DFS tree).
If node $N$ is an articulation point, then it must satisfy the following:

1. If $N$ is a root in a DFS tree, then $N$ must have at least two children.
2. If $N$ is not a root, then at least one of $N$'s children can't have a backedge back to the ancestors of $N$.

```

nodes = 1000
time = 0
visited = []
discovery = []
lowpoint = []
aps = {} -- a non-duplicating set
algorithm DFS(now, parent):
  children = 0
  time = time + 1
  visited[now] = true
  discovery[now] = lowpoint[now] = time

  for next in now.adjs:
    if visited[next] == false:
      children = children + 1
      DFS(next, now)
      lowpoint[now] = min(lowpoint[now], lowpoint[next])
      if parent != -1 and lowpoint[next] >= discovery[now]:
        aps = aps or {now} -- or union
    else: -- already discovered
      lowpoint[now] = min(lowpoint[now], discovery[next])

  if parent == -1 and children >= 2:
    aps = aps or {now}

algorithm Tarjan():
  for i from 0 to nodes:
    DFS(i, -1)
  return aps

```

This algorithm runs in linear time with its time complexity asymptote $O(V + E)$, which is lightning fast.

## Real Applications

Finding articulation points can be useful for finding the most important points in a network, since with the removal
of them comes two or more disconnected networks. They can also be used in social networks to find the most important
people for keeping the social network immediately/vicariously relevant to an existing group of people.

## Extended Insights

In an undirected graph, articulation points can be used to find biconnected graphs; furthermore, in a directional
graph, a similar concept can be used to procure strongly connected components with a subtle modification of Tarjan's
algorithm that introduces directional edges.
