So, I'm back to NixOS after installing back Windows for a while. Needless to say, I still have to
get used to it after having not been in the ecosystem for some time -- setting up everything to gain
some command-line adrenaline, reading logs on the latest updates... this kind of thing. The reason
I switched back to Windows was for gaming purposes. Before you start murmuring that "Gaming works
on my Linux machine", I was just tired of configuring everything, so I went back. Now, I don't feel
like gaming anymore. Watching a virtual leaderboard of virtual people doing virtual things and
gaining a virtual sense of accomplishment isn't what I really like after all. Switching back feels
nice. On other platforms, I can't just git clone and everything will be dandy, but on NixOS, this
statement can't be true enough.


Aside from switching back, I recently got into the rabbit hole of watching 10X developers streaming,
such as Tsoding and René Rebe. The thing that baffles me the most is the lack of syntax highlighting
in René's vi editor, but he said that it was for productivity reasons. I guess I'll have to try it
myself in the future, but right now, I'm sticking with my ol' reliable neovim default syntax
highlighting. Speaking about coding, I've run out of project ideas. Last thing I made was an
embedded project. I really should raise my own game and find some interesting stuff to do.
