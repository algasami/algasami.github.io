I want to work on a project, a real one with real applications. I have ideas but they seem to all be real, my projects
coming to a halt because I have lost my motivation midway. I'm having trouble making something concrete, something
polished enough to pass not just as a minimum viable product.

I should try using TODO lists, divide & conquer and focus on short-term goals rather than far-fetched long-term goals.
Though, people say that with narrow vision comes narrow achievements. This is for my own good to not abruptly stop.

See ya in the next article! (๑¯∀¯๑)
