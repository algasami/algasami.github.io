## My Previous Experience

Before I started working with the ESP32 & ESP8266, my experience with embedded systems was scarce. My only usage of
C, C++ and Assembly was for competitive programming and operating systems. My codes were all run on powerful machines
and I never had to worry about memory management, power consumption, or real-time constraints. This is why I was
flabbergasted when I first started working with the ESP8266.

## ESP32 (Smooth Sailing)

The ESP32 was a breeze to work with. It has a dual-core processor, 520KB of RAM, and 4MB of flash memory. My project
[ESP Rock](https://github.com/algasami/esp_rock) was a success and I was able to implement server hosting, AHRS analysis
and a useful web interface. The ESP32 was powerful enough to handle all of this and more. It didn't differ much from my
previous experience with C++ and I was able to use the STL and other libraries without any issues.

## ESP8266 (Rough Waters)

The ESP8266 was a different story. It has a single-core processor, 80KB of RAM, and 4MB of flash memory. My project
[IOT Connect](https://github.com/algasami/iot_connect) faced a lot of issues, particularly the OOM (Out of Memory) error,
which is notoriously difficult to debug, providing no useful information. Turns out, the async web server I was using
had memory leaks and I had to switch to the good ol' synchronous web server `<ESP8266WebServer.h>` to fix the issue.
For some reason, the ESP8266 also had issues with non-delaying analog reads, which I had to fix by using a non-blocking
delay.

```cpp
// Non-blocking delay example
void func() {
  static unsigned long lastMillis = 0;
  if (millis() - lastMillis > 1000) {
    lastMillis = millis();
    // Do something
  }
}
```

## New Learnings

First off, `PROG_MEM` is a thing. It's a special memory space that is used to store constant data in the flash, which is
useful for storing web pages, images, and other static data. Another thing I learned is that the ESP8266 hates dynamic
memory allocation, so I had to rewrite all my programs into stack-based memory allocation. Hopefully, I was already using
c style arrays and structs, so it wasn't too much of a hassle, but still, without all the debugging tools I'm used to,
it was a pain to find the root of the problem.

## Debugging Cheatsheet

- OOM (Out of Memory) Error: Use `ESP.getFreeHeap()` to check the free heap size. If it is decreasing over time or due
  to certain events, you have a memory leak, especially if it isn't being freed after the event. To find out what exactly
  is causing the memory leak... well, good luck :) (Yeah I'm serious)

- (Runtime) Alignment Error: Compile time alignment errors are easy to fix, but runtime alignment errors are a pain to
  debug; sometimes I find it even more frustrating to work with than memory leaks. The best way to debug this is to
  look for any pointer arithmetic or casting that might be causing the issue.

- Remember to `.end()`/`.close()`/`.stop()`: Always remember to close the file, stop the server, or end the LittleFS
  instance. This is a common mistake that can lead to memory leaks and runtime alignment errors. I like to introduce
  a garbage stack to store lambda functions that will be executed at the end of the program to ensure that everything
  is properly closed.

```cpp

//...
#include <stack>
#include <LittleFS.h>

std::stack<std::function<void()>> garbage;

void setupLittleFS() {
  LittleFS.begin();
  garbage.push([]() {
    LittleFS.end();
  });
}

void cleanup()
{
  while (!garbage.empty()) {
    garbage.top()();
    garbage.pop();
  }
}
```

- Use `PROGMEM` for static data: This is a no-brainer, but it's worth mentioning.

- Use `volatile` for shared variables: Easy to miss and can cause a lot of headaches (like bad performance, or even
  worse, UB).

## After Thoughts

While working with ESP8266 was a pain, it also gave me a sense of accomplishment. I was able to make a tiny little chip
do so much with so little resources (squeeze hard!). It was a humbling experience and I learned a lot from it. As somebody
once said, "Never judge a book by its cover," I would say, "Never judge a chip by its specs, and never think your code
would work the same on it!"
