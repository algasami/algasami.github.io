We can't brute-force this problem due to its complexity; thus, we need something else.

## Breaking the Problem Down

To solve this problem, we can think of smaller sub problems that can be solved more easily.
First of all, we need to find states that depend on previous ones to create a bottom-up solution.
Since this is a 2D grid, we can think of it as scanning through the grid column by column.
We represent the state space with $DP[i][j][s]$ where $i, j$ are the coordinates of our current target for the snakes
to go through and $s$ is an integer (profile) whose $y$-th bit represents whether there's a snake coming through it.
To understand this, please take a look at the image below. The $P$ and $Q$ are respectively previous and next profiles.
Think of them as borders of truth. Everything before $P$ has to be filled with snakes, and everything before $Q$ _will_ be
filled with snakes. Now, our task is to transform $P$ into $Q$.

_While phrased like we use $P$ to deduce $Q$, due to the nature of iterative solutions, we need to do the opposite._

## State Transition

In DP, sometimes you have to manipulate the indices themselves. We want to see how to transform the current profile to
the next profile when we fill our current block with a snake. In this chapter, we'll focus on all the possible cases.
We'll call a snake coming through a profile's certain unit "penetration."

_Black lines represent the current penetration, whereas blue lines represent the possible penetration._

### Outlet

This is the most straightforward one. If $Q[j+1]=Q[j]=0$, meaning there are no snakes coming through
outlets, the configuration is valid; therefore, it directly inherits the possibility from the previous state. Otherwise,
it would be invalid and set to zero.

$P = Q$
$DP[i][j][Q] = DP[i][j-1][P]$

### No Penetration

If no snakes will come through ($Q[j+1] = Q[j] = 0$), it means we must have an L-shaped penetration of the same snake.

$P=Q + 2^j + 2^{j+1}$

$DP[i][j][Q] = DP[i][j-1][P]$

### L-shaped Penetration

If a snake will come through both sides ($Q[j+1] = Q[j] = 1$), it means no penetration should occur previously.

$P = Q - 2^j - 2^{j+1}$

$DP[i][j][Q] = DP[i][j-1][P]$

### Single Penetration

This part is a little bit more complex, but overall trivial.
If there will only be one coming through ($Q[j+1] \oplus Q[j] = 1$), it means there has to be one penetration in the previous
state. Notice that there can be two possibilities, so we need to add them up.

$P_1 = Q, P_2 = Q \oplus (2^{j} + 2^{j + 1})$

$DP[i][j][Q] = DP[i][j-1][P_1] + DP[i][j-1][P_2]$

## Implementation in C

Here you go with some comments.
