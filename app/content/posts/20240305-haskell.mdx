## What is Haskell?

I know you have probably heard of Haskell before, but what exactly makes it different from other languages?
Haskell is a purely functional programming language, meaning that it is declarative rather than imperative.
This means that you tell the computer what you want to do, rather than how to do it. "Can you give me more examples?" you might ask.
Say no more, fam.

```haskell
add :: Int -> Int -> Int
add x y = x + y
```

"Oh it takes two integers and returns an integer, I see," you might say. However, this is not the case.
This is a function that takes an integer and returns a function that takes an integer and returns an integer, which is called
**function currying**. This is a very powerful concept in Haskell, and it allows for a lot of flexibility in how you can use functions.
For example, you can partially apply a function, which means that you can apply the function to some of its arguments and then
apply the rest later.

## What is Category Theory?

Since Haskell is a functional programming language, it is tightly connected to category theory, which is a branch of mathematics
that studies abstract structures and relationships between them. You can think of a category as a collection of objects and arrows
between them, where the arrows represent morphisms. For instance, a function $F : A \rightarrow A$ is a morphism from object of
type $A$ to another object of type $A$. It is called an endomorphism. We often draw the objects as small circles in a big circle (type),
and the arrows as lines between them. This is called a _commutative diagram_.

## Let's define some stuff!

### Functor

A functor is a type class that represents a mapping between two categories. It is defined as follows:

```haskell
class Functor f where
  fmap :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
```

Okay, what is this gibberish? Let's break it down. A functor is a type class, which means that it is a collection of types that
have some common properties. In this case, the common property is that they can be mapped over. The `fmap` function takes a function
from type `a` to type `b` and a functor of type `a`, and returns a functor of type `b`. This looks like taking something out of a box,
transforming it, and putting it back in the box. For example, the `Maybe` type is a functor, implemented as follows:

```haskell
instance Functor Maybe where
  fmap f (Just x) = Just (f x)
  fmap f Nothing = Nothing
```

I admit that the `f` in `Functor f` is a terrible name, because `f` does not represent a function that can be invoked, but rather a type
that supports the `fmap` function.

### Applicative

An applicative is a type class that represents a functor that can be applied to another functor. It is defined as follows:

```haskell
class Functor f => Applicative f where
  pure :: a -> f a
  (<*>) :: f (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
```

The `pure` function takes a value and returns a functor of that value. The `<*>` function takes a functor of a function from type `a` to type `b`
and a functor of type `a`, and returns a functor of type `b`. This looks like taking a function out of a box, taking a value out of another box,
applying the function to the value, and putting the result back in the box. For example, the `Maybe` type is an applicative, implemented as follows:

```haskell
instance Applicative Maybe where
  pure = Just
  Just f <*> m = fmap f m
  Nothing <*> _ = Nothing
```

### Monad

A monad is a type class that represents a functor that can be sequenced. It is defined as follows:

```haskell
class Monad m where
  return :: a -> m a
  (>>=) :: m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b
```

Since it can be sequenced, it is also a monoid in the category of endofunctors.
A monoid is a set with a binary operation and an identity element, while an endofunctor
is a functor from a category to itself. I'll spare you the rigorous proof of why a monoid in the category of endofunctors can be sequenced,
but the intuition is that you can take a value out of a box, apply a function to it, and put the result back in the original box, and do it
again and again. For example, the `Maybe` type is a monad, implemented as follows:

```haskell
instance Monad Maybe where
  return = Just
  Just x >>= f = f x -- So you can literally do this for a gazillion times!!!
  Nothing >>= _ = Nothing
```

## Conclusion

I hope this gives you a good idea of what Haskell is and how it is connected to category theory.
Well, it's time to go back to my cave and write some more Haskell code. See you next time, good morning, good afternoon, and good night!
