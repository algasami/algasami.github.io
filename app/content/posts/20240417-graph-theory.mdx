Graph theory revolves around graphs... evidently. Graphs are objects composed
of vertices and edges. An edge connects two vertices which can be the same.
Through graph theory, we can simplify convoluted problems, so please stay tuned.

## Definition

A graph is a set denoted as $G=V+E$ where $V$ is a set of vertices and $E$ is a set
of edges. We'll define some terms down here:

- edge: An edge that goes from $u$ to $v$ is represented as $e(u, v)$. If it is a directional
  edge, then $u \neq v \implies e(u,v) \neq e(v, u)$.
- loop: A loop is $e(n, n)$
- cycle: A cycle is a valid path that leads from one vertex to itself.
- weight: Vertices and edges can be assigned with weights -- numbers or information.

Graphs can be categorized, too. The most intuitive graph is a simple graph, which has no
loop or direction. The second most intuitive one is DAG(Directed Acyclic Graph), which has
no cycle.

## Topological Properties

Since graphs are a means of representing relationships between elements, the shapes of them
are not of top priority, so a graph can have arbitrarily placed vertices and edges without
impacting the structure of it, which is called isomorphism.

## Implementation of Graphs

There are many ways a graph can be implemented with varying complexities.

1. The first one is adjacency matrix

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#define MAX_NODES 100

size_t nodes = 0;
int adj[MAX_NODES][MAX_NODES] = {0};
/**
 * adj[x][y] = adj[y][x] = is connected or not
 */

int main()
{
    printf("nodes: ");
    scanf("%u", &nodes);
    printf("input edges x y (until -1):\n");
    while(1)
    {
        int x,y;
        scanf("%d %d", &x, &y);
        if(x < 0 || y < 0) break;
        adj[x][y] = adj[y][x] = 1;
    }
    for(size_t i = 0; i < nodes; i++)
    {
        printf("adjs of %d are: ", i);
        // linear search O(mn)
        for(size_t j = 0; j < nodes; j++)
        {
            if(i == j || !adj[i][j]) continue;
            printf("%d ", j);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
```

2. Second is adjacency list

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define MAX_NODES 100

size_t nodes = 0;
size_t adj[MAX_NODES][MAX_NODES + 1] = {0};

int main()
{
    printf("nodes: ");
    scanf("%u", &nodes);
    printf("input edges x y (until -1):\n");
    while(1)
    {
        int x,y;
        scanf("%d %d", &x, &y);
        if(x < 0 || y < 0) break;
        adj[x][adj[x][MAX_NODES]++] = y;
        adj[y][adj[y][MAX_NODES]++] = x;
    }
    for(size_t i = 0; i < nodes; i++)
    {
        printf("adjs of %d are: ", i);
        // 線性列舉O(m)
        for(size_t j = 0; j < adj[i][MAX_NODES]; j++)
        {
            printf("%u ", adj[i][j]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
```

When reading, adjacency matrix's upper bound is $O(n^2)$, adjacency list's being $O(n)$;
nevertheless, adjacency matrix's upper bound when checking whether or not two vertices
are connected is reduced to $O(1)$, whereas the adjacency list suffers from an $O(n)$ time
complexity.

## Special Graphs

These are some special graphs for special implementation.

### Bipartite Graph

A bipartite graph is composed of two graphs with null edge sets, so $G=(E_1 + E_2, V)$.
It can represent a variety of matching problems.

### Flow

Flow is a state of a graph. If a graph reaches the requirement of a graph, the weights of the input edges
and the weights of the output edges of a certain vertex must cancel each other out. Flows can be used to
solve scheduling, optimization problems. With the right algorithm and the right type of graph, the process
can be sped up. A graph that satisfies a flow must have a source and a sink vertex, respectively representing
the total input flow and the total output flow which must be equivalent.

## Graph Algorithms

### Depth/Breadth First Search/Traversal

When it comes to graph algorithms, we must first talk about the classic DFS and BFS. The former can be
represented as a stack or a recursion. The latter prioritizes neighboring vertices. BFS is often implemented
with queues. The generalized versions of them have non-polynomial time complexity, so optimization is vital.

### Maximum Matching Problem

In a graph, a matching is a subset of the edge set. In the version of the graph where the vertex set
is substituted with the matching, each point can only connect to another point at most, which looks
like a matching. The maximum matching problem asks if we can find a matching with the most points in a
graph. The time complexity of it is considerable. However, some theorems can help speed things up.

1. Kőnig's Theorem: Theorized by Dénes Kőnig in 1931 and proven with alternating paths (paths which
   go from non-matched edges and alternate between non-matched and matched edges), the theorem states
   that in any bipartite graphs, the number of edges in a maximum matching must be the same as the vertex
   count of a minimum vertex cover. With this theorem, we can use the minimum vertex cover to find the maximum
   matching.

2. Edmonds-Karp Algorithm: By attaching the $U$ set to a source and the $V$ set to a sink in a bipartite graph,
   and setting the weight of each edge to one, we can find the maximum matching by finding the maximum flow, since
   in order to find a flow, we must cut down all the neighboring points except one point of a subject. When we
   maximize this cutting process, we find the minimum vertex cover. Via Kőnig's theorem, we can procure the maximum
   matching.

```c
from = ∅
algorithm search_aug(res_graph, source, sink) returns boolean:
	visited := {source}, queue q
	append source to q
	while q ≠ ∅:
		c := front of q
		pop q
		for edge in edges that start from c:
			u := edge.from
			v := edge.to
			if v in visited or res_graph[edge] ≤ 0:
				continue
			if v == sink:
				from[v] := u // found the sink
				return true
			append v to q
			from[v] := u
			append v to visited
	return false

algorithm edmonds_karp(flow_network, src, sink) returns number:
	res_graph := flow_network, max_flow := 0 // init residual graph
	while search_aug(res_graph, src, sink):
		path_flow := INT_MAX
		v := sink
		repeat // find the minimum capacity of alternating paths
			u := from[v]
			path_flow := min(path_flow, res_graph[edge(u, v)])
			v := u
		until v == src
		v := sink
		repeat // add inversions
			u := from[v]
			res_graph[edge(u, v)] -= path_flow
			res_graph[edge(v, u)] += path_flow
			v := u
		until v == src
		max_flow += path_flow
	return max_flow
```

3. Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm: The DFS version of Edmonds-Karp.

```c
visited := ∅
algorithm find_path(u_node) returns boolean:
	if u_node ∈ visited:
		return false
	for v_node in u_node.edges:
		if v_node.match == null:
			v_node.match := u_node
			return true
		if v_node.match != u_node and find_path(v_node.match):
			v_node.match := u_node // inversion
			return true
		// can't find alternating paths here
	return false
algorithm max_matching(U, V, E) returns number:
	matches := 0
	for u_node in U:
		visited := ∅
		if find_path(u_node):
			matches := matches + 1
	return matche
```

### Shortest Path Problem

The shortest path problem has a wide range of application, with the most straightforward one being finding
the shortest path between two points on a map. It may seem trivial at first, but the time complexity of solving
it would be gigantic with BFS or brute force, so some algorithms that utilize dynamic programming have sprung
up.

1. Traditional Flooding: It uses flood-like traversal technique, which is really slow.

2. Djikstra Algorithm: It uses dynamic programming to memorize the current state, lowering the complexity to
   $O(n \log {n})$. The advantage of Djikstra is its weakness, it can find the shortest path to a given point for
   all points on the map. When it comes to implementation, flooding uses queue, where Djikstra uses priority
   queues. The lower the priority is (closer to the source), the faster it gets processed, which means $p(v)=d(v)$,
   because it has a larger chance to find the shortest path.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

#define MAX_NODES 100

size_t nodes;
int adjweight[MAX_NODES][MAX_NODES];
int adjlist[MAX_NODES][MAX_NODES + 1] = {0};
size_t previous[MAX_NODES];
int mindist[MAX_NODES];
int visited[MAX_NODES] = {0};

size_t from, to;

/**
 * Define Priority Queue
 */
struct PriorityData {
    size_t node;
    int priority;
};

struct PriorityQueue {
    struct PriorityData data[MAX_NODES];
    size_t size;
};

int _priority_queue_cmp(struct PriorityData const *const a,
                        struct PriorityData const *const b) {
    return a->priority - b->priority;
}

int empty(struct PriorityQueue *const pq) { return !pq->size; }

void enqueue(struct PriorityQueue *const pq, struct PriorityData val) {
    pq->data[pq->size++] = val;
    qsort(pq->data, pq->size, sizeof(struct PriorityData),
          (int (*)(const void *, const void *))_priority_queue_cmp);
}

struct PriorityData dequeue(struct PriorityQueue *const pq) {
    struct PriorityData x = pq->data[0];
    for (size_t i = 1; i < pq->size--; i++) {
        pq->data[i - 1] = pq->data[i];
    }
    return x;
}

struct PriorityQueue traverse_queue = {.size = 0};

int main() {
    memset(mindist, -1, sizeof(mindist));
    printf("Node Count: ");
    scanf("%zu", &nodes);
    printf("Edges x y w until 0 0 0: \n");

    while (1) {
        size_t x, y;
        int w;
        scanf("%zu %zu %d", &x, &y, &w);
        if (x == 0 && y == 0 && w == 0)
            break;
        if (x == y)
            continue;

        adjweight[x][y] = adjweight[y][x] = w;
        adjlist[x][adjlist[x][MAX_NODES]++] = y;
        adjlist[y][adjlist[y][MAX_NODES]++] = x;
        /**
         * This combines the fast det. of adj matrices
         * and the speed of array traversal
         */
    }

    printf("From: ");
    scanf("%u", &from);
    printf("To: ");
    scanf("%u", &to);

    mindist[from] = 0;

    enqueue(&traverse_queue,
            (struct PriorityData){.node = from, .priority = 0});

    while (!empty(&traverse_queue)) {
        size_t node = dequeue(&traverse_queue).node;
        visited[node] = 1;
        for (size_t i = 0; i < adjlist[node][MAX_NODES]; i++) {
            size_t adjnode = adjlist[node][i];
            if (visited[adjnode])
                continue;

            int thisdist = mindist[node] + adjweight[node][adjnode];
            if (mindist[adjnode] < 0 || (mindist[adjnode] > thisdist)) {
                mindist[adjnode] = thisdist;
                previous[adjnode] = node;
            }
            enqueue(&traverse_queue,
                    (struct PriorityData){.node = adjnode,
                                          .priority = mindist[adjnode]});
        }
    }

    printf("best: ");
    size_t current = to;
    while (current != from) {
        printf("%d<-", current);
        current = previous[current];
    }
    printf("%d", current);

    return 0;
}
```

3. A\* Algorithm: The A\* algorithm (A Star) is almost identical to Djikstra, with the only difference being
   that the priority of a target depends not only on the distance of it from the source but also a heuristic
   function that is "informed" with additional information about the graph. In $p(v)=d(v)+h(v)$, $h(v)$ is often
   the shortest distance between the source and the target in the physical space. It isn't hard to see that
   A\* depends on the non-topological properties of a graph, so it is not isomorphism-friendly.
