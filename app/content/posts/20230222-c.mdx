C is strong, C is tough, <br/>
With each line, we code and strut. <br/>
Armed with loops and functions grand, <br/>
We conquer all, with C in hand. <br/>

<br />

Pointers, arrays, and structs abound,<br/>
Our code, a fierce battleground.<br/>
In C, we write with raw power,<br/>
A language fit for the strongest hour.<br/>

<br />

So let us code, and let us reign,<br/>
For in C, we conquer all domains.<br/>
With each compile, we raise our swords,<br/>
For C is king, in coding hordes.

```c:example.c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("I eat steaks!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

## Side-note

This is a fun little poem I wrote to help me remember the basics of the C programming language. I hope you enjoyed it!

Just kidding it was generated with an LLM. I'm not that creative.
