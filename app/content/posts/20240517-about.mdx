Welcome to my portfolio that also acts as a miniature blog! This post is intended to help you understand the site's
philosophy and functionalities. Details are shown below.

## Home

This is the index of my site. You can assess my abilities in academy, as well as checking out my projects. I tried to
be as neutral as possible during the curation of my portfolio. Note that the timeline may be slightly inaccurate since
it was written in retrospect.

## Development

Development is a small developer log functionality I added to the site about a year ago. It seldom gets updated due to
maintenance issues; hence, currently the development page serves as a brief introduction to the site.

## Posts

The post page is the heart of the site. In the column view, rows of purple buttons are present. They are called tags
and serve as a decoupled way to categorize posts. These buttons can be turned on and off. When on, they appear to be
orange and filter out posts without the specified tags. As for individual posts, some of them have a special purple badge
that reads "Pinned." They are pinned onto the top of the page for easy navigation.

When you enter a post, you can view its metadata on the top row and its content below. When you click on headings, the
url becomes suffixed by the heading's ID. Sharing this suffixed url makes all the visitors who have clicked on this link
automatically scroll to the heading.

## Graph

Graph is the most interactive part of the site. Offering bipartite graph maximum matching finder and shortest path
algorithm visualizer, this page is perfect for introducing graph theory to adolescents.

## Knots

This is a three.js visualizer. It looks primitive and has limited functionality. I added it with a full 3D portfolio
in my mind, but I never realized the full picture due to the difficulty of programming and modeling such sites.

## Technical Details

Two years ago, I had built a small portfolio in my old account [Penquuin](https://github.com/penquuin), which
can still be access on [penquuin.github.io](https://penquuin.github.io). This site was pretty primitive since I was still
getting the hang of web development, but it was also during that period I got in contact with Next.js and React.

This site is the old site's successor. Built with the latest Next.js feature (v14) and powered by ContentLayer, Rehype
and Remark, the site combines their strong suits into different parts of the site. ContentLayer is used as the extended
markdown (mdx) parser, whereas Rehype and Remark are part of the Unified pipeline.

It wouldn't be possible to build this site without all the open source contributors around the world.
