How do we rationalize irrational ideas? Here's my approach.

# World A

After WWII, peace was not restored; instead, the tension between nations started to grow, with resources depleted due to wars.
A group of scientists were designated to a confidential project by the US government to hopefully "keep the world machine rolling
to the right direction". Details of it are the following.

## Entanglement

When two objects are entangled, their information has an explicit relationship, namely a morphism that can transform one information to another.
For example, when two electrons are entangled. They have opposite spin directions. You can know another electron's spin by looking at one with
its superposition collapsed. Note that there is no information being transferred, so entanglement is instantaneous.

## Tanglators

Archeological research has shown that ancient civilizations worshipped some sacred items which could seemingly link two entities together.
These items are called the Artifacts by archeologists. The properties of them could not be determined solely by deciphering ancient manuscripts, though.
Some argue that the Rosetta Stone was erected as the symbol of "entanglement", as translation itself can be thought as one to an extent.

## E.R.A

Subsequent to the Manhattan project, the Entanglement Research Agency (ERA) was established in demand for the rapid development in Soviet's nuclear technology.
Located directly underneath its predecessor, the ERA enjoyed a well-guarded laboratory with a multitude of apparatus and facilities. Being deep underground also
means that its members could capture and interact with elementary particles that would be interfered by weather conditions. In 1952, Dr.Ganzorig became the first
person recorded to ever interact with a tanglator (Tanglator 0) at ground zero after the detonation of a miniature nuclear warhead.
