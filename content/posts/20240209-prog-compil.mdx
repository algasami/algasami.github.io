# Path?

## Normal Type (College Student)

- Python/Lua/Javascript/... -> C/C++ -> Assembly -> (HDL OPTIONAL) -> Haskell
- OOP -> FP -> Other paradigms

Common Problems: Some think they have become one of the best, but in reality, they are nothing but
novices. So, hide your aura, and if you are humbled one day, don't forget your ambition.

## Math Background

- Lambda Calculus -> Haskell -> (Scala OPTIONAL) -> C/C++ -> Assembly -> Python/Lua/Javascript...
- FP -> OOP -> Other paradigms

Common Problems: Some think they are capable of handling all the new knowledge. Truth is, those who
think they are not prepared are the ones who can overcome all the burdens facing them.

## Self-taught

- C/C++ -> Assembly -> HDL (Highly recommended) -> Haskell -> Python/Lua/Javascript...
- Be proficient at all paradigms

Common Problems: Classic Dunning-Kruger effect in action! Some consider themselves "top-notch", others
think themselves tiny fish in a huge ocean. In reality, they are the opposite of their thoughts.

## Postsript

Wherever you started, wherever you are right now, chances are you have to move forward. Actually, "running" forward is
your only means of survival. The world has been accelerating faster and faster than ever before, so don't
fall behind. Be the one who outruns others. Learn as much as you can and reap what you have planted.
