Praise is an approach for others to show you their benevolent intention.
I always feel like I'm not that much of a master to be deemed as being fluent in certain
things. Flushed and embarrassed, I appreciate endorsement, while I face my real self
-- an imposter. I have a deceiving appearance -- an intimidating and skilled programmer
who has a loud personality; in reality, I am the opposite. I hate the arrogant version of me,
but I can't get rid of my cynical tones, like a serpent drowning in its own venom.

<br/>

I shall escape. It's suffocating here, and I don't want to
hear a single thing about me, nor do I want to have my ego inflated even further.
This is why I use low-level languages, as I can stay in a tiny clique (echo chamber in reality)
consisting of me and some other so-called "gurus" in my school.
